        <h1>Network Closet</h1>
        <h2>Located on the lower level of the museum, the network closet contains the two PCs which control the projectors and screens on the fifth floor.</h2>
        <p>The closet is room number 0741, and can be accessed via the doors next to collections management, or via the doors by security.</p>
        <p>Getting into the hallway itself requires a PIN; if you are a Harvard Art Museum employee, speak to security about setting one up.</p>
        <p>The larger of the two PCs controls the nine screens, while the narrower controls the two projectors, although other arrangements are occassionally devised based on the needs of the project.</p>
        <p>If you are trying to <a href="pcaccess.html">access these PCs</a>, this is the most direct route to do so.</p>
        <p id="usb">USB ports are available on the front of each PC: in order to access the ones on the projector PC, open the right-hand panel on its front.</p>
        <p id="disk">The screen PC also has a disk drive, which can be accessed, again, by opening the panel on its front.</p>
        <p id="poweron">If the PCs have been turned off (outside of the usual scheduled cycle), this is the only place from which they can be turned on: simply press the power button on the relevant device(s).</p>
